# Data Structures

Data structures can be classified as either:

- **Linear**
- **Non-Linear**: data elements are randomly arranged. The elements are non-arranged sequentially and they can have multiple relationships. Examples include: trees, graphs, hash table, set. 

## Linear Structures

Linear data structures present data elements linked to one another in a particular order.

### Array

An array is one of the fundamental data structures in programming. They allow storing multiple elements of the same type in a single variable, providing a way to organize and access data efficiently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An array is a collection of elements, each identified by at least one index or key. The size of the array is defined at the time of its creation and usually remains fixed in size.
